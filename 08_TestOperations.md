### TestOperations.md

The following instructions will let you download and run a test version of the grading script so you fix any issues with your code before submitting it.

1. Download the TestOperation directory

```
curl -O -J -L https://github.com/My-UofE/ECM1410-2025T2-PairProgrammingCoursework/raw/refs/heads/main/TestOperation_v1.zip
```

2. Unzip. This will create a directory TestOperation in your repository (then remove the zip file to tidy up!).

```
unzip -o TestOperation_v1.zip; rm TestOperation_v1.zip
```

3. Look in the `README.md` file in the `TestOperation` directory for instructions on how to install.
